## Middleware
/src/middleware.ts             | middleware| n/a       | Supabase session refresh on all non-static routes

## Auth Protection Notes
- Protected routes: Auth check via `getAuthUser()` in each API handler
- Author routes: Auth check + Author table lookup by email
- User isolation: All queries filter by `userId` from authenticated session
- Supabase RLS: Row-level security policies enforce user can only access own data
- Share tokens: Public access to /shared/[token] retrieves entry via token lookup (no userId check)
- Content access: FREE content is public, PAID content checks subscriber status

## Rate Limiting
- /api/subscribe: 5 req/min per IP (prevents spam signups)
- /api/unsubscribe: 30 req/min per IP
- Cron routes: Protected by CRON_SECRET bearer token

## Server Actions (Form Mutations)
- src/lib/actions/newsletter.ts: subscribeAction (form-based newsletter signup with Zod validation)
- src/lib/actions/entries.ts: createEntryAction, updateEntryAction, deleteEntryAction

## Background Jobs (Vercel Cron)
- /api/cron/reminders: Daily at 9:00 UTC - sends reminder emails via Resend to users who haven't journaled

## Database Models (Prisma)
### Author System
- Author: Multi-author profiles (email, name, slug, bio, avatarUrl, stripeAccountId)
- Content: Newsletters, blogs, articles (type, status, access, title, slug, body, tags)
- AuthorSubscriber: Per-author subscriber list (for paid content access)
- ContentType enum: NEWSLETTER | BLOG | ARTICLE
- ContentStatus enum: DRAFT | PUBLISHED | ARCHIVED
- ContentAccess enum: FREE | PAID
